# [GitAdder](https://github.com/davidolivefarga/GitAdder)

A simple desktop application to help users perform their code commits using Git.

# Background

On one of the projects I worked on we had a Bitbucket as our code repository, so in order to update the code we needed to make commits with Git. As I was new to Git, a teammate introduced me on how to use this tool, and one thing I noticed was that in order to commit multiple files from different folders, it was necessary to open a command window and add file by file using relatives paths depending on the current console location. In addition, it was hard to keep track which files were added and which were not, and if you had the bad luck to add a file you didn't want to add, you had to start all over again.

In light of this situation, I decided to develop a simple desktop application using Java Swing to help me and my teammates make these commits. I'm relatively new to software developing, so my code isn't probably the best. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements, so feel free to collaborate as much as you want.

_P. S. I'm aware that there are many applications out there that are WAY BETTER and have more features than my desktop application, like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), but I wanted to develop something in my free time and, besides its utility, this application was an excuse to learn Java Swing and develop a desktop application from scratch._
